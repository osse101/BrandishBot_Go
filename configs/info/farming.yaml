    **Farming & Compost** 🌾

    Grow your wealth over time with the Farming system!

    ## 🚀 How to Play

    1. **Wait**: Your farm accumulates rewards passively.
    2. **Harvest**: Use `/harvest` to collect your items.
    3. **Repeat**: The longer you wait (up to 1 week), the better the rewards!

    ## ⚠️ Warning

    *   **Spoilage**: Don't wait *too* long! Crops spoil after 2 weeks of neglect.
    *   **Minimum**: Wait at least 1 hour between harvests.
    *   **XP**: Farming awards **Farmer XP** (after 5 hours).

    ## 🎁 Rewards

    *   **Compost**: Find lootboxes, items, and crafting materials.
    *   **Unlock**: Upgrade the Compost Bin in the Progression Tree to get better loot!
