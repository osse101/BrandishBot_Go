# Discord Info Command Documentation

This directory contains feature information text files for the `/info` command.

Each `.txt` file corresponds to a feature option in the command:
- `overview.txt` - General BrandishBot information
- `economy.txt` - Economy system details
- `inventory.txt` - Inventory management
- `crafting.txt` - Crafting and upgrades
- `gamble.txt` - Gambling system
- `progression.txt` - Progression tree
- `stats.txt` - Stats and leaderboards
- `commands.txt` - Available commands list

## Format

Files should be plain text with markdown-like formatting for Discord embeds.

## Usage

The `/info [feature]` command loads the appropriate `.txt` file and displays it in a colored embed.
