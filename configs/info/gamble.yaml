        **📦 Lootbox Gambling**

        Bet lootboxes against other players - winner takes all!

        ## 🎰 How It Works
        1. Someone starts a gamble with `/gamble`
        2. Others join with `/join-gamble`
        3. After the timer, all lootboxes are opened
        4. Highest total value wins ALL the loot!

        ## � Start a Gamble
        ```
        /gamble [lootbox-type] [quantity]
        ```
        **Example:** `/gamble lootbox1 2` (Starts a gamble betting 2x lootbox1)

        **What happens:**
        - Creates a new gamble session
        - Other players have ~2 minutes to join
        - Your lootboxes are reserved (can't use them)
        - Timer starts automatically

        ## 🤝 Join a Gamble
        ```
        /join-gamble [gamble-id] [lootbox-type] [quantity]
        ```
        Join an active gamble! You can bet:
        - Same lootbox type
        - Different lootbox types
        - Different quantities

        ## 🏆 Winning
        - Player with highest total value wins everything.
        - Tie-breaker: Random selection among tied players.
