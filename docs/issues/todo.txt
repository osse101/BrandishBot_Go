GetVotingSession -- Formatting error (ResponseFormatter.cs)
/stats/user -- 1) user_id also requires platform 2) platform & username should also be acceptable inputs
VotingStarted Websocket -- Session ID is not worth sending.  It is not used by the client.  This should send the same data as GetVotingSession.
NodeUnlockProgress(internal) -- Logging needs to display contribution amount and total required as raw values.  Currently displays nothing.
CycleCompleted Websocket -- This should only send the feature that was unlocked, I think.  There is overlap with VotingStarted.  If we can, votingstarted should be the only one announcing the next vote.  There should be a slight delay between Node unlock and new vote started (on the client side, like a delayed publish).
