# Archived Documentation

This directory contains project-specific historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained but kept for reference.

## Contents

### migration-squash-report.md
Detailed report from the January 2026 migration squashing effort that consolidated 29 development migrations into a single v1.0 baseline. Contains project-specific details, issues encountered, and lessons learned.

**For general migration squashing guidance**, see [docs/architecture/database-migration-squashing.md](../architecture/database-migration-squashing.md).

## Purpose

Archived documents serve as:
- Historical record of major project changes
- Reference for understanding past decisions
- Learning material for similar future efforts
- Audit trail for production changes

## When to Archive

Documents should be archived when:
- General guidance has been extracted into architecture docs
- The content is project-specific and time-bound
- The information is valuable but not actively needed
- It would clutter the main docs directory
